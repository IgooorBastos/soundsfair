## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a symbolic, abstract illustration representing digital money creation by central banks without physical printing presses. Show a clean, minimalist modernist central bank building (simple rectangular architecture, geometric, corporate) positioned on the left third of the composition. From this building, visualize streams of digital data flowing outward to the right - represented as flowing patterns of binary numbers (0s and 1s), dollar signs ($), and abstract currency symbols, all rendered in glowing muted red (#FF4444) to represent inflation and money creation. These digital streams should dissolve and fade as they spread outward, suggesting the dilution and debasement of currency value. The building itself should be rendered in clean white line art or solid white with subtle geometric patterns, maintaining a corporate/institutional aesthetic. Use a pure black background (#000000) for maximum contrast. The style should be flat vector illustration with subtle transparency effects for the flowing digital elements, creating a sense of motion without animation. Avoid any literal printing press imagery, mechanical gears, or physical money. This should convey the abstract, digital nature of modern monetary expansion (QE, reserve creation, balance sheet expansion). The composition should feel technical and systematic, not whimsical or cartoonish - more like a financial diagram or corporate presentation slide. No human figures should be present. Clean, professional aesthetic suitable for economic education.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (More Abstract):
Central bank icon (building silhouette) with expanding concentric circles of dollar symbols radiating outward, increasing in size but decreasing in opacity. Represents monetary expansion. Black background, muted red expanding waves, white bank building. Geometric and symbolic.

### Variation B (Flow Diagram Style):
Left side: solid central bank building icon. Center: abstract flow of digital currency (represented by $ and binary code). Right side: dissolving into pixel fragments. Shows creation and debasement as a process. Technical diagram aesthetic.

### Variation C (Keyboard Metaphor):
Close-up view of a single keyboard "Enter" key being pressed, with numbers and currency symbols flowing out from it. Represents digital money creation with a keystroke. Black background, glowing red symbols flowing upward, clean and simple.
