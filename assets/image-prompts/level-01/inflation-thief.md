## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a minimalist, symbolic illustration showing the concept of inflation as wealth theft over time. Show a clean, geometric representation of a stack of gold coins gradually fading and dissolving from left to right across a horizontal timeline spanning three distinct time markers: 1950, 1985, and 2023. The leftmost stack (1950) should be full height representing 100% purchasing power, shown in bright libertarian gold (#FFD000). The middle stack (1985) should be approximately half the height, with some coins beginning to fade and dissolve into muted red particles. The rightmost stack (2023) should be a tiny remaining stack, only 5% of the original height, heavily faded with most coins dissolved into floating red particle effects representing lost value. Use a pure black background (#000000) for maximum contrast. Style should be flat design with subtle shadows for depth, abstract and symbolic rather than literal or photorealistic. The timeline should be a thin horizontal white line connecting the three points, with year labels in clean sans-serif typography (Inter font style). The dissolving effect should use muted red (#FF4444) to represent inflation's destructive force. No text labels within the image itself except for the three years. Professional infographic aesthetic with high contrast and educational clarity. The composition should feel sobering and factual, not alarmist or conspiratorial.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (More Abstract):
Symbolic representation of purchasing power erosion: three vertical gold bars decreasing in height left to right (1950: 100%, 1985: 50%, 2023: 5%), connected by a downward diagonal line. Black background, libertarian gold bars with transparency gradient showing decline. Minimalist geometric style.

### Variation B (Timeline Emphasis):
Horizontal timeline infographic showing a single gold coin duplicating and shrinking across decades. 1950: one large coin, 1985: multiple smaller coins, 2023: tiny fragments. Black background, gold to red color transition, clean vector style.

### Variation C (More Dramatic):
Abstract visualization of a melting golden structure (representing savings) deteriorating over time from solid geometry to fragmented particles. Three stages shown side by side, black background, cinematic lighting, symbolic rather than literal.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 1, Section 4: "The Inflation Machine"
- Directly after the paragraph explaining "$1 in 1950 = $0.05 in 2023"

**Purpose:**
- Visualize the abstract concept of purchasing power loss
- Make the 95% statistic tangible and memorable
- Establish the "theft" metaphor without being inflammatory

**Accompanying Text:**
> "As the chart above shows, inflation doesn't just reduce prices—it systematically erodes the value of your savings over decades. What cost $1 in 1950 requires $20 today."

```
--no photograph, photo-realistic, 3d render, cluttered, busy, text overlay, meme style, cartoon, anime, low quality, blurry, people, faces
```

**Style Keywords to Include:**
- "minimalist infographic"

## DALL-E 3 Adaptation

If using DALL-E 3, emphasize:
- "Clear geometric shapes"
- "Infographic style for education"
- "No photorealism"
- "Symbolic and abstract"
- "Professional design aesthetic"

DALL-E tends toward photorealism, so explicitly request flat/vector style.

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Concept is immediately clear (wealth erosion over time)
✅ Colors match brand identity (gold/black/red)
✅ Minimalist and uncluttered
✅ Professional educational quality
✅ High contrast and legible
✅ Symbolic rather than literal

**Reject and regenerate if:**
❌ Too photorealistic or 3D rendered

❌ Wrong colors (not matching brand)
❌ Text is included in image (years should be minimal)
❌ Looks like a meme or cartoon
❌ Low resolution or blurry
