## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Design a clean, minimalist three-panel comparison chart showing currency hyperinflation acceleration across three historical examples. Create three vertical panels arranged horizontally, each representing: Zimbabwe (2008), Venezuela (2018), and Weimar Germany (1923). Each panel should contain an exponentially rising line graph rendered in bold muted red (#FF4444), showing inflation rates reaching catastrophic levels. All three graphs should use the same vertical scale on the left (0% at bottom to 1,000,000,000% at top, logarithmic scale) to emphasize the exponential nature of hyperinflation and allow for direct comparison. The background should be pure black (#000000) with thin gold grid lines (#FFD000 at 20% opacity) for reference. Each panel should be clearly labeled at the top with the country name and year in white text (Inter font style, 16-18px equivalent). The graphs should look like technical financial charts, not artistic interpretations - clean, precise, data-focused. Below each graph, include a small text label showing the peak inflation rate ("79,600,000,000% monthly" for Zimbabwe, etc.). Style should be serious data visualization aesthetic appropriate for academic or financial analysis, not sensationalist. The overall composition should emphasize the universal pattern: fiat currencies, when abused, collapse in similar exponential patterns regardless of time period or geography. Clean, factual, educational tone - like what you'd see in an IMF or World Bank report.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Simplified):
Three side-by-side bar charts showing peak inflation rates. Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Weimar - each as a single red vertical bar reaching different but catastrophic heights. Black background, gold horizontal reference lines, white labels. Minimalist comparison.

### Variation B (Single Unified Graph):
All three hyperinflation curves overlaid on one chart, each in different red shades, showing the similar exponential pattern. Emphasizes universality of fiat failure. Legend identifies each country/year.

### Variation C (Timeline Emphasis):
Horizontal timeline showing these three events spread across the 20th-21st century (1923, 2008, 2018), with vertical red spikes at each point. Shows that hyperinflation is not a "past problem."

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 1, Section 5: "The Failures of Fiat Money Throughout History"
- After discussing Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Weimar examples

**Purpose:**
- Show universality of fiat currency failure patterns
- Demonstrate exponential nature of hyperinflation
- Provide historical evidence across different eras and continents
- Emphasize that this is a systemic issue, not isolated incidents

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Hyperinflation follows remarkably similar exponential patterns whether in 1920s Germany, 2000s Zimbabwe, or 2010s Venezuela. When fiat currencies lose credibility, the collapse accelerates with mathematical predictability."
