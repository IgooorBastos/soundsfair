## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Design a clean, minimalist timeline infographic showing the evolution from commodity-backed money (gold standard) to pure fiat currency, displayed horizontally from left to right. The timeline spans from 1944 to 2024 with three major milestone markers clearly indicated: (1) Bretton Woods 1944 - represented by an isometric geometric gold bar icon in bright gold (#FFD000), (2) Nixon Shock 1971 - represented by a broken chain or severed link icon in muted red (#FF4444) symbolizing the breaking of the gold peg, and (3) Petrodollar System 1974-present - represented by a simplified isometric oil barrel icon in muted blue (#4477FF). Use a pure black background (#000000) for maximum contrast. The timeline itself should be a clean horizontal white line connecting these three points. Each milestone should have its year labeled below in white text (Inter font style, 14-16px equivalent), with a very brief label above each icon ("Gold-Backed Era", "Gold Link Broken", "Oil-Backed Dollar"). Style should be flat design with subtle isometric perspective on the icons only, maintaining an educational infographic aesthetic. Clean, professional, corporate/institutional feel appropriate for economic history. No photorealism, no clutter, high contrast with ample white space. The composition should feel like a museum timeline exhibit—authoritative, factual, and clear.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Simpler):
Three-panel horizontal timeline: Panel 1 (1944) - gold bar symbol, Panel 2 (1971) - red X over gold, Panel 3 (1974) - oil barrel. Black background, connected by gold arrow turning red. Minimalist icons only.

### Variation B (More Detailed):
Horizontal timeline with four eras marked: Pre-1971 (gold standard, green glow), 1971 event (Nixon Shock, red flash), 1974 transition (petrodollar, blue shift), 2024 present (question mark, suggesting change). Clean infographic style.

### Variation C (Symbolic):
Abstract representation: solid gold foundation cracking (1971), transitioning to floating dollar symbols backed by oil droplets (1974-present). Side-by-side comparison, black background, symbolic geometric shapes.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 1, Section 2: "The History of Modern Fiat Systems"
- After paragraph explaining Bretton Woods and before Nixon Shock details

**Purpose:**
- Establish three-era framework (gold standard → transition → petrodollar)
- Show historical discontinuity (promise broken in 1971)
- Provide temporal context for understanding current fiat system

**Accompanying Text:**
> "The modern fiat system emerged through three critical moments: the Bretton Woods agreement that established dollar-gold parity, Nixon's 1971 decision to break that promise, and the 1974 petrodollar arrangement that gave the dollar new backing through oil trade."
