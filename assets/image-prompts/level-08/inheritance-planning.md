## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create an educational flowchart showing the process and options for Bitcoin inheritance planning, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). Design the chart as a decision tree or process flow with three main strategies arranged vertically: Strategy 1 (Top, 33% of canvas) - "Multi-Signature Inheritance": Show a 2-of-3 multi-sig setup. Visualize with three key icons in gold (#FFD000): "Your Key" (you hold), "Trusted Family/Friend Key" (family holds), "Attorney/Third Party Key" (attorney holds). Show that upon your passing, family + attorney can access funds (2 keys required). Label: "Most Secure - Requires Technical Setup". Strategy 2 (Middle, 33%) - "Seed Phrase Backup with Instructions": Show a seed phrase (represented as paper document in white) stored in secure location (vault icon), with separate instruction document explaining how to use it. Label: "Medium Security - Risk of Discovery or Loss". Indicate split storage: seed in bank safe deposit, instructions with attorney. Strategy 3 (Bottom, 33%) - "Trusted Custodian with Dead Man's Switch": Show funds with professional custodial service (represented by institutional building icon in blue #4477FF) with automatic release trigger if you don't check in periodically. Label: "Easiest - Counterparty Risk". To the right, add a checklist in white: "☐ Ensure heirs know Bitcoin exists", "☐ Document how to access", "☐ Test recovery process", "☐ Update as tech changes", "☐ Consider legal/tax implications". Below all strategies, add a critical warning in red: "Without inheritance plan, Bitcoin may be lost forever. Plan ahead." The style should be estate planning / legal advisory quality - serious, practical, emphasizing the unique challenges of self-custodied digital assets. No morbid imagery, just clear succession planning guidance.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Risk Comparison Matrix):
Table showing three strategies (multi-sig, seed backup, custodian) rated across factors: Security (High/Medium/Low), Complexity (High/Medium/Low), Counterparty Risk (None/Low/High), Cost (Medium/Low/Medium). Helps compare trade-offs at a glance.

### Variation B (Family Education Emphasis):
Show process of educating heirs: (1) Introduce them to Bitcoin, (2) Show them how wallets work, (3) Practice recovery with small amounts, (4) Document full access process, (5) Review annually. Step-by-step family preparation guide.

### Variation C (Common Failure Modes):
Show three failure scenarios in red: (1) "Heirs don't know Bitcoin exists" → lost, (2) "Seed phrase lost/destroyed" → lost, (3) "Heirs can't understand instructions" → lost. Then show solutions in gold. Problem-solution framing.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 8, Section 4: "Inheritance and Succession Planning"
- Near end of Level 8, after security best practices

**Purpose:**
- Address often-overlooked inheritance challenge
- Provide practical inheritance strategies
- Emphasize unique challenges of digital assets
- Encourage proactive planning

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Self-custody means your Bitcoin dies with you if you don't plan ahead. Unlike traditional assets, there's no 'forgot my password' option—if your heirs can't access your keys, your Bitcoin is lost forever. Plan inheritance using multi-signature setups, documented seed phrase backups, or trusted custodians. Most importantly: ensure your heirs know Bitcoin exists and how to recover it."

## Educational Emphasis

This is a critical but often neglected topic. The visualization should:
1. **Emphasize urgency** - Bitcoin without inheritance plan is at risk of permanent loss
2. **Provide concrete options** - Not just "figure it out," but specific strategies
3. **Show trade-offs** - Security vs convenience vs complexity
4. **Encourage testing** - Don't wait until it's too late to verify heirs can recover

The tone should be serious but not morbid—this is practical estate planning for digital assets.
