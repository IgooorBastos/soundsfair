## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean infographic showing three different portfolio allocation strategies with varying Bitcoin percentages, displayed as three pie charts arranged horizontally on a pure black background (#000000). Show three risk profiles from left to right: Chart 1 (Left) - "Conservative (Low Risk)": Pie chart with: 60% Bonds/Cash (light gray #C0C0C0), 35% Stocks/ETFs (blue #4477FF), 5% Bitcoin (gold #FFD000). Label: "5% Bitcoin - Capital Preservation Focus". Chart 2 (Center) - "Moderate (Balanced)": Pie chart with: 40% Bonds/Cash (gray), 45% Stocks/ETFs (blue), 10-15% Bitcoin (gold). Label: "10-15% Bitcoin - Growth with Protection". Chart 3 (Right) - "Aggressive (High Risk/Reward)": Pie chart with: 20% Bonds/Cash (gray), 50% Stocks/ETFs (blue), 25-30% Bitcoin (gold). Label: "25-30% Bitcoin - Maximum Upside Exposure". Each pie chart should be clearly labeled with percentages inside or next to each slice. Use consistent color coding across all three charts. Below the charts, add a recommendation box: "Start with 5-10% and increase as you understand Bitcoin better. Never invest more than you can afford to lose." Include a small disclaimer: "Not financial advice - illustrative allocation examples only." The style should be financial planning / investment advisory quality - professional, conservative, practical. No hype, no get-rich-quick framing - focused on prudent allocation as part of diversified portfolio. The visual should help readers think about appropriate allocation based on their risk tolerance.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Timeline Rebalancing):
Show how allocation changes over time for one investor: Year 1 (5% BTC), Year 3 (10% BTC), Year 5 (15% BTC). Shows gradual increasing exposure as knowledge/conviction grows. Timeline-based allocation strategy.

### Variation B (Allocation vs Outcomes):
Three scenarios showing different allocations (5%, 10%, 20% BTC) and their portfolio impact over 5 years. Shows how even small allocations can significantly improve outcomes. Data-driven allocation justification.

### Variation C (Risk-Return Plot):
Scatter plot showing different allocation percentages on risk-return axes. Traditional portfolio (60/40) at lower risk/return, portfolios with increasing BTC % moving right/up (higher risk/return). Classic financial visualization.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 8, Section 2: "Bitcoin Allocation in Investment Portfolio"
- After DCA discussion and before security/storage sections

**Purpose:**
- Provide concrete allocation guidance
- Show risk-appropriate allocation ranges
- Discourage all-or-nothing thinking
- Emphasize starting small and learning

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Bitcoin allocation should match your risk tolerance. Conservative investors might start with 5% as portfolio insurance. Balanced portfolios could allocate 10-15% for growth potential. Only aggressive investors comfortable with volatility should consider 25%+ allocations. Start small, learn, and adjust as your understanding grows."

## Ethical Note

This visualization provides educational examples, not personalized investment advice. It should:
1. **Emphasize starting small** (5% is reasonable for most)
2. **Match risk tolerance** (not everyone should be "aggressive")
3. **Include disclaimers** (this is not financial advice)
4. **Avoid hype** (Bitcoin is volatile, appropriate for risk-tolerant only)

The goal is to help readers think about allocation rationally, not to maximize Bitcoin exposure regardless of circumstances.
