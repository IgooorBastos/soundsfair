## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create an educational infographic showing a tiered security pyramid for Bitcoin storage based on amount held, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). Design a pyramid divided into three horizontal tiers, from bottom (largest) to top (smallest): Tier 1 (Bottom, 50% of pyramid) - "Small Amounts ($0-$1000)": Color: Blue (#4477FF). Storage method: Mobile/Desktop hot wallets. Icons: Phone, computer. Security level: "Convenient, Low Security". Examples: BlueWallet, Electrum. Label: "For daily spending and learning." Tier 2 (Middle, 30% of pyramid) - "Medium Amounts ($1000-$50,000)": Color: Orange (#FFA500). Storage method: Hardware wallets. Icons: Ledger/Trezor-style device. Security level: "Balanced Security and Usability". Label: "For savings and medium-term holding." Tier 3 (Top, 20% of pyramid) - "Large Amounts ($50,000+)": Color: Gold (#FFD000). Storage method: Multi-signature cold storage or institutional custody. Icons: Multiple keys, vault. Security level: "Maximum Security". Label: "For long-term wealth preservation. Consider professional solutions." To the right of the pyramid, add a checklist of universal best practices in white text: "✓ Never share your seed phrase", "✓ Use strong passwords/PINs", "✓ Enable 2FA where possible", "✓ Verify receiving addresses", "✓ Test with small amounts first", "✓ Keep software updated". Below the pyramid, add a warning box in red: "Most Bitcoin losses are from user error, not hacks. Education is your best security." The style should be cybersecurity education / operational security quality - serious, practical, emphasizing graduated security based on amount at risk. No fear-mongering, no overly technical jargon - focused on actionable guidance.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Attack Vector Diagram):
Show common threats (phishing, malware, physical theft, exchange hacks) as red arrows attacking different storage methods. Then show which security practices block which attacks. Defense-in-depth visualization.

### Variation B (Security Spectrum):
Horizontal spectrum from "Convenience" (left, hot wallets) to "Security" (right, multi-sig cold storage). Show different solutions positioned along spectrum with trade-off indicators. Helps users choose based on priorities.

### Variation C (Step-by-Step Setup):
Sequential diagram showing proper hardware wallet setup process: (1) Buy from official source, (2) Generate seed offline, (3) Write seed on paper (not digital), (4) Test recovery, (5) Send small test amount, (6) Verify security. Operational checklist.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 8, Section 3: "Security and Storage Best Practices"
- After allocation strategy and before inheritance planning

**Purpose:**
- Match security to amount at risk (proportional security)
- Provide tiered approach (not one-size-fits-all)
- List critical security practices
- Emphasize user responsibility

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Security should scale with the amount at risk. Small amounts for daily use can stay in convenient mobile wallets. Significant savings require hardware wallets. Large holdings demand multi-signature cold storage or institutional solutions. Most losses come from user error—learn proper security practices before accumulating significant Bitcoin."

## Design Checklist

- [ ] Pure black background (#000000)
- [ ] Pyramid with three tiers:
  - [ ] Tier 1 (bottom, blue #4477FF): Hot wallets, $0-$1K
  - [ ] Tier 2 (middle, orange #FFA500): Hardware wallets, $1K-$50K
  - [ ] Tier 3 (top, gold #FFD000): Cold storage/multi-sig, $50K+
- [ ] Each tier labeled with:
  - [ ] Amount range
  - [ ] Storage method
  - [ ] Security level
  - [ ] Use case
- [ ] Icons representing storage types (phone, hardware device, vault)
- [ ] Best practices checklist (right side, white text)
- [ ] Warning box (bottom, red): User error is main risk
- [ ] Cybersecurity education aesthetic
- [ ] 16:9 aspect ratio

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Three security tiers clearly distinguished
✅ Amount ranges appropriate and practical
✅ Security methods match tier (proportional)
✅ Colors match specifications (blue/orange/gold)
✅ Best practices checklist comprehensive
✅ Warning about user error included
✅ Professional cybersecurity education quality

**Reject if:**
❌ Tiers unclear or poorly defined
❌ Amount ranges unrealistic
❌ Security overkill for small amounts (impractical)
❌ Missing critical best practices
❌ Looks fear-mongering or alarmist
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Too complex or technical

## Educational Emphasis

This visualization should reinforce:
1. **Proportional security** - Don't use cold storage for $100, don't use hot wallet for $100K
2. **Graduated approach** - Start simple, increase security as holdings grow
3. **User responsibility** - You are your own bank, you are your own security team
4. **Common-sense practices** - Most important security is basic hygiene

Avoid creating paralysis through excessive complexity. Security should scale with need.
