## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a conceptual visualization showing Bitcoin as a tool for preserving wealth across generations, displayed as a family tree or generational timeline on a pure black background (#000000). Design the image with three generations represented vertically or in family tree structure: Generation 1 (Top/Left) - "You (Present)": Show an abstract figure (white silhouette) holding/protecting Bitcoin (₿ symbol in gold #FFD000). Show them practicing: self-custody (key icon), DCA accumulation (growing stack), education (book icon). Label: "Accumulate, Secure, Learn". Generation 2 (Middle) - "Your Children": Show Bitcoin being passed down (inheritance arrow in gold) to next generation. Show children learning (smaller book icons), understanding value preservation, continuing accumulation. Label: "Inherit, Continue, Preserve". Generation 3 (Bottom/Right) - "Their Children (Future)": Show Bitcoin value preserved and potentially grown across decades (larger ₿ symbol), with third generation benefiting from foresight two generations prior. Label: "Generational Freedom". Along the timeline, show key contrasts: Traditional Wealth Transfer (shown in muted red #FF4444 as a declining line): "Inflation erodes → Estate taxes → Asset depreciation → Generational poverty cycle". Bitcoin Wealth Transfer (shown in gold as stable or rising line): "Fixed supply → Self-custody (no permission needed) → Portable across borders → Generational sovereignty". Add a quote beneath: "Generational wealth isn't about leaving money—it's about leaving freedom." The style should be legacy planning / philosophical reflection quality - serious, long-term oriented, emphasizing multi-decade thinking. No get-rich-quick framing, no speculation - focused on preservation and sovereignty across time.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Wealth Erosion vs Preservation):
Two timelines side by side. Left: "Fiat savings over 50 years" (declining red line showing inflation erosion). Right: "Bitcoin over 50 years" (stable or rising gold line showing value preservation). Generational time horizon comparison.

### Variation B (Family Education Tree):
Show family tree where knowledge (not just Bitcoin) is passed down. Root: "Bitcoin education today". Branches: Children learn sovereignty, grandchildren inherit both Bitcoin AND knowledge. Emphasizes teaching, not just transferring assets.

### Variation C (Time Capsule Metaphor):
Show Bitcoin as time capsule preserving value from 2024 to 2074 (50 years). Left: "2024 - 1 BTC deposited". Right: "2074 - 1 BTC retrieved (still 1 BTC, scarcity preserved)". Contrast with fiat losing 95%+ over same period.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 9, Section 3: "Building Generational Wealth with Bitcoin"
- After financial freedom journey, before final call to action

**Purpose:**
- Extend time horizon beyond immediate future
- Show Bitcoin's value for multi-generational planning
- Emphasize preservation over speculation
- Inspire long-term thinking and responsibility

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Bitcoin's fixed supply makes it uniquely suited for generational wealth preservation. Unlike fiat currency, which loses purchasing power over decades, Bitcoin's scarcity ensures value cannot be inflated away. By accumulating, securing, and educating your children about Bitcoin, you preserve not just wealth, but financial sovereignty for generations to come."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Three generations clearly shown
✅ Bitcoin preservation across time emphasized
✅ Contrast with fiat erosion visible
✅ Colors match specifications (gold for BTC, red for fiat)
✅ Long-term thinking emphasized
✅ Abstract and symbolic (not literal family photos)
✅ Focuses on freedom/sovereignty over wealth accumulation

**Reject if:**
❌ Generations unclear or missing
❌ Looks like get-rich-quick scheme
❌ Too realistic (family photos, faces)
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Speculative framing (price predictions)
❌ Doesn't convey preservation concept
❌ Missing contrast with traditional wealth transfer

## Educational Emphasis

This visualization should inspire multi-generational thinking:
1. **Long time horizon** - Think in decades, not quarters
2. **Preservation over accumulation** - Protecting what you have matters more than chasing gains
3. **Education as inheritance** - Teaching children about Bitcoin is as important as leaving them Bitcoin
4. **Sovereignty as legacy** - Financial freedom is what you're really passing down

The tone should be thoughtful and responsible, not speculative or materialistic.
