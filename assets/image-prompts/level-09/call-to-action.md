## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean, actionable checklist/roadmap showing concrete first steps for beginning a Bitcoin journey, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). Design the image as a vertical or stair-step progression with 6-8 actionable steps, each marked with a checkbox and clear icon: Step 1: "Educate Yourself" - Book icon in white. Text: "Complete this course, read Bitcoin Standard, follow Bitcoin educators". ☐ Checkbox to left. Step 2: "Set Up Wallet" - Wallet icon in gold (#FFD000). Text: "Start with mobile wallet (BlueWallet, Muun) to learn basics". ☐ Checkbox. Step 3: "Buy Your First Satoshis" - Bitcoin symbol (₿) in gold. Text: "Even $10 is enough to start. Use reputable exchange (Coinbase, Swan, Strike)". ☐ Checkbox. Step 4: "Practice Self-Custody" - Key icon in gold. Text: "Send small amount to your wallet. Verify you control the keys". ☐ Checkbox. Step 5: "Start DCA Strategy" - Calendar/recurring icon in blue (#4477FF). Text: "Set up weekly or monthly automatic purchases ($25-100)". ☐ Checkbox. Step 6: "Upgrade Security" - Shield icon in green (#10B981). Text: "After accumulating $1000+, get hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor)". ☐ Checkbox. Step 7: "Plan Inheritance" - Document icon in orange (#FFA500). Text: "Create recovery plan. Ensure family can access if needed". ☐ Checkbox. Step 8: "Continue Learning" - Graduation cap icon in white. Text: "Bitcoin evolves. Stay educated, verify information, think long-term". ☐ Checkbox. At the top, add a bold title in gold: "Your Bitcoin Journey Starts Today". At the bottom, add an encouraging note: "Every expert started exactly where you are now. The first step is always the hardest—and the most important. Start small, learn continuously, take responsibility for your financial future." The style should be productivity checklist / getting-started guide quality - clear, actionable, encouraging. No hype, no pressure - just practical first steps anyone can take today.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Timeline Roadmap):
Show recommended actions across first year: Month 1 (education, first purchase), Month 3 (regular DCA established), Month 6 (hardware wallet), Month 12 (review and optimize). Timeline-based progression with milestones.

### Variation B (Decision Tree):
Flowchart helping users choose first actions based on their situation: "New to Bitcoin?" → Education path. "Have Bitcoin on exchange?" → Self-custody path. "Ready to accumulate?" → DCA path. Personalized guidance.

### Variation C (Minimal First Steps):
Ultra-simple 3-step visual: (1) Learn (this course), (2) Buy (any amount), (3) Hold (self-custody). Everything else is refinement. Removes paralysis through simplicity.

## Educational Emphasis

This is the final image of the entire course. It should:
1. **Inspire action** - Knowledge is useless without application
2. **Remove paralysis** - Start small, these steps are easy
3. **Provide clear path** - Specific actions, not vague advice
4. **Encourage responsibility** - You are in control of your journey

The tone should be encouraging and supportive, like a good coach at the end of training: "You've learned the theory, now go apply it. Start simple, start today."
