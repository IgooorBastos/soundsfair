## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create an inspiring yet grounded visualization showing the journey from financial dependence to financial sovereignty through Bitcoin, displayed as a horizontal path/roadmap on a pure black background (#000000). Design a visual journey with five stages progressing from left to right: Stage 1 (Far Left, 15% width) - "Financial Dependence": Show a figure (abstract silhouette in muted red #FF4444) trapped behind bars or in a cage representing debt, inflation, and central control. Label: "Debt, Inflation, No Control". Stage 2 (20% width) - "Awareness": Show the same figure discovering Bitcoin (small ₿ symbol appearing, first light in gold #FFD000). Label: "Education Begins". Stage 3 (25% width) - "Learning & Action": Show figure actively engaging: reading (book icon), dollar-cost averaging (coins accumulating), securing funds (vault icon). Label: "Knowledge → Action". Stage 4 (25% width) - "Building Sovereignty": Show growing stack of Bitcoin (larger ₿ symbols), self-custody (key in hand), decreasing reliance on traditional finance. Label: "Self-Custody, Independence". Stage 5 (Far Right, 15% width) - "Financial Freedom": Show figure liberated (no cage, standing in gold light), with Bitcoin as foundation beneath them (solid gold base). Label: "Sovereignty Achieved". Connect stages with a path or timeline arrow in gold, progressing from dark (left) to light (right). Below the journey, add an insight: "Financial freedom is not about getting rich—it's about escaping dependence on systems you don't control." The style should be motivational infographic with philosophical depth - inspiring but realistic, emphasizing the process over overnight transformation. No hype, no lambos, no materialism - focused on genuine liberation through knowledge and action.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Before/After Split):
Simple two-panel comparison. Left: "Traditional Finance" showing dependency cycle (bank → debt → inflation → back to bank) in red. Right: "Bitcoin Sovereignty" showing freedom cycle (earn → save in BTC → preserve value → freedom) in gold. Clear contrast.

### Variation B (Maslow's Hierarchy Adaptation):
Pyramid showing financial freedom hierarchy. Base: "Exit fiat system" (foundations). Middle: "Self-custody, DCA" (security). Top: "Full sovereignty, generational wealth" (self-actualization). Bitcoin-specific needs hierarchy.

### Variation C (Skill Tree):
Game-style skill tree showing progressive Bitcoin knowledge/action milestones: "Level 1: First BTC purchase", "Level 2: Self-custody", "Level 3: Regular DCA", "Level 4: Multi-sig", "Level 5: Generational planning". Gamified learning path.

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Five stages clearly distinguishable
✅ Progression from dependence to freedom obvious
✅ Emphasizes process over instant results
✅ Colors match specifications (red → gold)
✅ Abstract and symbolic (not literal)
✅ Inspirational without being unrealistic
✅ No materialistic imagery (cars, yachts, etc.)

**Reject if:**
❌ Stages unclear or confusing
❌ Looks like get-rich-quick scheme
❌ Includes materialistic symbols (lambos, etc.)
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Too realistic (should be abstract/symbolic)
❌ Doesn't convey "process" nature of journey
❌ Hype-based rather than wisdom-based

## Educational Emphasis

This is the philosophical culmination of the course. The visualization should emphasize:
1. **Freedom ≠ Wealth** - This is about independence, not getting rich
2. **Process over outcome** - Journey metaphor, not instant transformation
3. **Knowledge → Action** - Education leads to practical steps
4. **Sovereignty as goal** - Self-custody and control, not speculative gains

Avoid any framing that suggests Bitcoin is a shortcut to material wealth. The focus is on escaping financial dependence and achieving genuine sovereignty.
