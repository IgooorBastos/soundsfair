## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clear educational diagram showing the difference between custodial and self-custody Bitcoin storage, displayed as a two-panel comparison on a pure black background (#000000). Left Panel (50% width) - "Custodial Storage (Exchange)": Show a simplified representation of a user (abstract wallet icon in white) with their Bitcoin (₿ symbol in gold #FFD000) stored inside a third-party box/vault labeled "Exchange" (in muted red #FF4444). Show that the exchange holds the private keys (represented by a key icon in red inside the exchange vault). Add warning indicators: "You don't control the keys", "Exchange can freeze funds", "Counterparty risk". Label below: "Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins". Right Panel (50% width) - "Self-Custody (Your Wallet)": Show the same user icon, but now their Bitcoin is stored in their own wallet (represented by a secure vault icon in gold) with the private key icon firmly in the user's possession (gold key in user's hand or wallet). Add green checkmarks: "You control the keys", "No one can freeze funds", "No counterparty risk". Label below: "Your Keys, Your Coins - Full Sovereignty". Use simple iconography: vault/box for storage, key for private keys, ₿ for Bitcoin. The style should be educational security infographic - clear, practical, emphasizing the critical importance of self-custody. No photographs, no complex technical details - focused on the fundamental principle: key custody = ownership. The visual should immediately convey that only self-custody provides true ownership.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Risk Comparison):
Show two scenarios over time. Left: Custodial storage → Exchange hacks/bankruptcy → User loses Bitcoin (red X). Right: Self-custody → User always has access (green checkmark). Timeline-based risk demonstration.

### Variation B (Key = Ownership):
Simple visual equation: "Private Keys" (key icon in gold) = "Bitcoin Ownership" (₿ in gold). Then show two cases: Keys with third party = Third party owns your Bitcoin. Keys with you = You own your Bitcoin. Minimalist logic diagram.

### Variation C (Castle Metaphor):
Left: Your gold stored in someone else's castle (they control the gate). Right: Your gold in your own castle (you control the gate). Medieval fortress metaphor for custody. More accessible/visual metaphor.

✅ Professional security education quality
✅ Simple and accessible (not overly technical)

**Reject if:**

## Educational Emphasis

This visualization should reinforce the foundational security principle of Bitcoin: private key custody determines ownership. Many beginners don't understand this distinction, so clarity is paramount. The visual should be immediately actionable: "I need to move my Bitcoin to self-custody."
