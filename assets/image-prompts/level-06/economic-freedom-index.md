## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a powerful world map visualization showing Bitcoin's importance for economic freedom across different regions, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). Show a simplified, stylized world map (continents in dark gray #2A2A2A) with different regions highlighted based on economic freedom status and Bitcoin relevance. Divide regions into three categories using color overlays: (1) High Economic Freedom / Stable Currency regions (North America, Western Europe, Japan, Australia) - subtle blue overlay (#4477FF at 30% opacity) with small Bitcoin symbols, labeled "Bitcoin as Investment/Store of Value", (2) Medium Economic Freedom / Moderate Inflation regions (Eastern Europe, parts of Asia, South America) - orange/yellow overlay (#FFA500 at 30% opacity) with medium Bitcoin symbols, labeled "Bitcoin as Inflation Hedge + Remittance", (3) Low Economic Freedom / High Inflation / Capital Controls regions (Venezuela, Argentina, Lebanon, Turkey, Zimbabwe, Nigeria) - bright gold overlay (#FFD000 at 40% opacity) with large prominent Bitcoin symbols, labeled "Bitcoin as Economic Survival Tool". Add small indicator icons for key factors: inflation symbol (red), capital controls symbol (red lock), banking crisis (red warning). Include a legend explaining the categories. At the bottom, add a key insight: "Bitcoin's utility scales with economic instability—from investment to survival tool." The style should be geopolitical analysis / human rights report quality - serious, factual, data-driven. No propaganda, no emotional imagery - focused on objective economic freedom metrics and Bitcoin's differential utility across contexts. The map should demonstrate that Bitcoin's value proposition is different depending on local economic conditions.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Economic Freedom Index Integration):
Show world map colored by Heritage Foundation Economic Freedom Index scores (gradient from red=low freedom to green=high freedom), with Bitcoin adoption rates overlaid (larger ₿ symbols in lower freedom regions). Shows inverse correlation.

### Variation B (Use Case Distribution):
Three separate regional callouts showing primary Bitcoin use cases: Developed world (speculation/investment), Emerging markets (remittance/savings), Restricted economies (economic survival). Shows context-dependent utility.

### Variation C (Capital Controls Map):
World map showing countries with capital controls (red shading) vs free capital movement (green). Bitcoin symbols concentrated in capital control regions. Emphasizes Bitcoin's escape valve function.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 6, Section 5: "Bitcoin as Economic Liberation Tool"
- Near end of Level 6, summarizing freedom themes

**Purpose:**
- Show Bitcoin utility varies by economic context
- Emphasize importance for economically oppressed regions
- Demonstrate real-world use cases beyond speculation
- Counter narrative that Bitcoin is "only for rich speculators"

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Bitcoin's value proposition differs dramatically based on local economic conditions. In stable economies, it serves as a store of value and investment. In high-inflation environments, it protects purchasing power. In economically repressive regimes, it becomes an essential economic survival tool—the difference between preservation and confiscation of wealth."

## Midjourney-Specific Tips

**Recommended Parameters:**
```
--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6 --s 250
```

**Negative Prompts:**
```
--no photographs, realistic imagery, 3d render, artistic interpretation, propaganda, political bias, complex details, country borders
```

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Three economic categories clearly distinguishable
✅ Bitcoin importance scales with economic instability
✅ Colors match specifications (blue/orange/gold)
✅ Professional geopolitical analysis quality
✅ Factual and neutral tone (not propagandistic)
✅ Shows context-dependent utility
✅ Emphasis on economic freedom correlation

**Reject if:**
❌ Categories are unclear or confusing
❌ Looks politically biased or propagandistic
❌ Too complex (country-level borders unnecessary)
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Doesn't show utility scaling principle
❌ Too artistic (should be analytical)
❌ Missing key regions (Venezuela, Nigeria, etc.)

## Data Source Reference

This visualization can reference:
- **Heritage Foundation Economic Freedom Index**
- **Cato Institute Human Freedom Index**
- **Bitcoin adoption data:** Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index
- **Inflation data:** IMF, World Bank
- **Capital controls:** International Monetary Fund AREAER

Ensure regional categorization roughly aligns with objective economic freedom metrics.

## Ethical Note

This visualization should be factual and empathetic, not exploitative. Bitcoin's importance in economically repressed regions is a serious matter of economic survival, not a marketing angle. The tone should be respectful and data-driven.
