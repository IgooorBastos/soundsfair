## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a powerful symbolic visualization contrasting censored vs censorship-resistant payment systems, displayed as a two-panel side-by-side comparison on a pure black background (#000000). Left Panel (50% width) - "Traditional Finance: Censorable": Show a simplified transaction flow from sender to receiver (represented by abstract human silhouettes or wallet icons in white) with a large barrier/wall (red #FF4444) blocking the path between them. Above the barrier, show authority symbols: bank icon, government icon, or gavel/law icon in red, representing centralized control points that can freeze, reverse, or block transactions. Include a red "X" or "BLOCKED" text over the transaction path. Label below: "Single Points of Control Can Deny Service". Right Panel (50% width) - "Bitcoin: Censorship-Resistant": Show the same sender-to-receiver flow, but the path between them is a mesh network of nodes (small interconnected dots in gold #FFD000) forming multiple possible routes. Even if some nodes are blocked or removed (shown as missing nodes with red X), alternative paths remain, ensuring the transaction reaches its destination. Show the transaction flowing successfully through the network in gold. Label below: "No Single Point of Control - Permissionless Access". Use directional arrows to show transaction flow. The style should be technical network diagram mixed with civil liberties infographic - serious, factual, emphasizing the architectural difference that enables freedom. No photographs, no faces, no emotional imagery - pure structural comparison demonstrating how network topology determines censorship resistance.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Border/Sanctions Scenario):
Show geographic borders (represented by walls) that traditional finance cannot cross (blocked by red barriers), while Bitcoin flows freely across all borders (gold arrows passing through unimpeded). Emphasizes international freedom of transaction.

### Variation B (Account Seizure):
Left: Traditional bank account with a padlock controlled by authority (red). Right: Bitcoin wallet with key held only by user (gold). Emphasizes self-custody vs custodial control. Simple icon-based comparison.

### Variation C (Permissioned vs Permissionless):
Show two doors. Left: "Permissioned System" door with gatekeeper/bouncer (can deny entry, red). Right: "Permissionless System" door open to all (gold, no gatekeeper). Metaphor for asking permission vs freedom of access.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 6, Section 2: "Bitcoin as Censorship-Resistant Money"
- After explaining centralized control and before financial sovereignty

**Purpose:**
- Visualize abstract concept of censorship resistance
- Show structural basis for freedom (network topology)
- Demonstrate why Bitcoin cannot be blocked
- Contrast with traditional finance control points

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Traditional financial systems have centralized control points where authorities can freeze accounts, block transactions, or seize funds. Bitcoin's decentralized network architecture eliminates these single points of control, making censorship technically infeasible. No permission is required to transact."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Contrast between systems immediately clear
✅ Censorship mechanism visible (barrier/authority)
✅ Network topology shows resilience
✅ Colors match specifications (red vs gold)
