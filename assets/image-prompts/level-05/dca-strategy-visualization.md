## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clear infographic showing how dollar-cost averaging works in practice, using Bitcoin as the example asset, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). The composition should be divided into two main sections: Top section (40% of canvas): Show a simplified Bitcoin price chart from 2020-2023 with significant volatility - peaks and valleys rendered as a white line graph showing realistic price fluctuations. Overlay this chart with evenly spaced vertical gold arrows (#FFD000) pointing downward at regular monthly intervals, representing consistent monthly purchases regardless of price. Each arrow should be the same size, emphasizing equal dollar amounts invested. Label this section: "DCA Strategy: Buy Fixed Amount Monthly (Regardless of Price)". Bottom section (60% of canvas): Show a comparison table with three columns: Column 1: "Month" (Jan 2020, Feb 2020, ... Dec 2020 - show 12 months as example), Column 2: "BTC Price" (varying prices: $7000, $9000, $6000, $8500, etc.), Column 3: "BTC Purchased" (amounts that vary inversely with price: when price is low, more BTC purchased; when high, less BTC). The final row should show totals: "Total Invested: $12,000", "Total BTC Acquired: X.XXX BTC", "Average Cost: $X,XXX per BTC". Use color coding: white for month labels, blue (#4477FF) for prices, gold (#FFD000) for BTC amounts purchased. The style should be educational infographic mixed with financial planning document - clear, practical, actionable. No photographs, no artistic interpretation - focused on demonstrating the mechanical simplicity and benefit (buying more when cheap, less when expensive) of DCA strategy.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Lump Sum vs DCA):
Two-panel comparison. Left: "Lump Sum Investment" showing single large purchase (may buy at peak or valley). Right: "DCA Strategy" showing multiple smaller purchases averaging out price. Shows risk mitigation benefit. Side-by-side comparison.

### Variation B (Accumulation Over Time):
Show a stack of Bitcoin growing over time (represented as growing stack of gold coins or increasing BTC number). Each month adds to the stack. Bottom shows cumulative BTC amount increasing. Emphasizes accumulation mindset.

### Variation C (Volatility Averaging):
Show how DCA "smooths out" volatility. Volatile price chart in background (dramatic peaks and valleys), with DCA average cost shown as a much smoother line cutting through the middle. Demonstrates averaging effect visually.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 5, Section 5: "Investment Strategies: DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)"
- After asset comparison and before security/storage sections

**Purpose:**
- Teach practical DCA implementation
- Show mechanical simplicity (same amount, regular intervals)
- Demonstrate automatic "buy low more, buy high less" benefit
- Reduce anxiety about timing the market

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Dollar-cost averaging removes the need to time the market. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals (weekly, monthly), you automatically buy more Bitcoin when prices are low and less when prices are high. This mechanical strategy reduces emotional decision-making and smooths volatility."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ DCA concept is immediately clear
✅ Regular purchase intervals obvious (equal spacing)
✅ Table shows inverse relationship (price vs amount)
✅ Final totals demonstrate averaging benefit
✅ Colors match specifications
✅ Professional financial education quality
✅ Mechanically simple to understand

**Reject if:**
❌ DCA mechanism unclear
❌ Purchase intervals appear irregular
❌ Table math doesn't demonstrate principle
❌ Too complex or cluttered
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Looks like trading advice rather than education
❌ Missing totals or key data

## Educational Note

This visualization should emphasize that DCA is:
1. **Mechanical** - No market timing required
2. **Emotional** - Removes fear/greed from decisions
3. **Accessible** - Works with any budget
4. **Long-term** - Focus on accumulation, not short-term price

Avoid any implication of guaranteed returns or trading strategy. This is educational content about a risk-mitigation approach, not financial advice.
