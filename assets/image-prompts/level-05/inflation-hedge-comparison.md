## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a dual-axis comparison chart showing Bitcoin's fixed supply schedule against fiat money supply expansion over time (2009-2023), displayed on a pure black background (#000000). The composition should feature two overlapping line charts with different Y-axes: Left Y-axis (0 to 21M BTC): Show Bitcoin's total supply curve approaching but never exceeding 21 million, rendered as a smooth curve in bright gold (#FFD000) that asymptotically approaches the 21M hard cap (shown as a horizontal gold reference line). The curve should show rapid early growth (2009-2016) then progressively flattening after each halving. Right Y-axis (M2 Money Supply in USD Trillions, 0 to 25T): Show US M2 money supply exploding upward, especially post-2020, rendered as a steep line in muted red (#FF4444) shooting upward dramatically. Mark the 2020 COVID stimulus period with a vertical reference line where the red line goes nearly vertical. The X-axis shows years from 2009 to 2023. Include clear axis labels and a legend distinguishing the two lines: "Bitcoin Supply (Fixed, 21M Cap)" in gold and "USD M2 Money Supply (Infinite)" in red. Above the chart, title it "Fixed vs Infinite: Bitcoin Supply vs Fiat Money Supply (2009-2023)". Add a key insight box at the bottom: "While central banks printed 50%+ more dollars in 2 years, Bitcoin's issuance declined on schedule." The style should be economic analysis/financial journalism quality - similar to what you'd see in The Economist or Financial Times. Clean, professional, data-focused. The visual should create stark contrast between Bitcoin's predictable scarcity and fiat's exponential expansion.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Purchasing Power Focus):
Overlay three lines: Bitcoin purchasing power (rising, gold), USD purchasing power (declining, red), and Bitcoin supply (capped, gold dashed line). Shows not just supply but real value preservation. Emphasizes inflation protection outcome.

### Variation B (Velocity Comparison):
Show rate of change (first derivative) instead of absolute values. Bitcoin issuance rate declining (gold, downward slope), Fiat issuance rate accelerating (red, upward slope). Emphasizes diverging trajectories.

### Variation C (Future Projection):
Extend timeline to 2140. Show Bitcoin approaching 21M asymptotically (gold curve flattening), while fiat M2 projection continues exponential growth (red curve shooting to infinity). Emphasizes long-term divergence.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 5, Section 3: "Bitcoin as Protection Against Inflation"
- After explaining inflation mechanics and before DCA strategies

**Purpose:**
- Visualize stark contrast between fixed and infinite supply
- Show empirical data (not theoretical)
- Emphasize 2020-2023 money printing surge
- Demonstrate Bitcoin's predictable scarcity

**Accompanying Text:**
> "While Bitcoin's supply follows a mathematically enforced schedule approaching 21 million, fiat money supplies can expand without limit. The US M2 money supply increased over 40% between 2020-2021 alone, while Bitcoin's issuance rate continued declining on its predetermined halving schedule."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Both supply curves clearly visible and distinguishable
✅ Bitcoin cap (21M) clearly shown and respected
✅ Fiat expansion dramatic (especially post-2020)
✅ Dual axes labeled correctly
✅ Colors match specifications (gold/red)
✅ Professional economic analysis quality
✅ Stark contrast between fixed and infinite is obvious

**Reject if:**
❌ Curves are unclear or overlapping confusingly
❌ Bitcoin supply shown exceeding 21M
❌ Fiat expansion understated
❌ Axes mislabeled or missing
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Too artistic (should be data-focused)
❌ 2020 surge not emphasized
