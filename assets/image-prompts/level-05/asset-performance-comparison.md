## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean multi-line chart showing cumulative performance of different store-of-value assets from 2013 to 2023, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). Show five assets as separate line charts with logarithmic Y-axis (to accommodate Bitcoin's higher returns): (1) Bitcoin - bright gold line (#FFD000), most dramatic upward trajectory despite volatility, (2) Gold - muted gold line (#D4AF37), relatively flat with slight upward trend, (3) S&P 500 - blue line (#4477FF), moderate upward trend, (4) Real Estate (US Housing Index) - green line (#10B981), steady moderate upward trend, (5) Cash/USD - red line (#FF4444), declining slightly (showing inflation erosion). The X-axis spans 2013-2023 with year markers. Use a logarithmic Y-axis from 100 (baseline in 2013) to 100,000+ to show percentage growth. Each line should be labeled with the asset name and final 10-year return percentage (e.g., "Bitcoin +12,000%", "Gold +45%", "S&P 500 +180%", etc.). Include a clear legend and title: "10-Year Store of Value Performance Comparison (2013-2023)". Add a subtle grid in dark gray (#2A2A2A) for reference. Below the chart, include a key insight: "All returns adjusted to USD baseline (100 in 2013)". The style should be investment analysis/financial advisory quality - professional, data-focused, factual. No photographs, no artistic interpretation - pure comparative data visualization. The composition should show Bitcoin's volatility but also its superior long-term performance as a store of value.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Inflation-Adjusted):
Same chart but with all assets adjusted for CPI inflation (real returns). Shows even starker contrast - Bitcoin massively positive, cash deeply negative, others modest. Emphasizes inflation erosion.

### Variation B (Risk-Adjusted):
Include Sharpe ratio or volatility bands around each line. Shows Bitcoin's higher volatility alongside higher returns. More sophisticated investment analysis. Suitable for advanced audience.

### Variation C (Portfolio Allocation):
Show how different portfolio allocations performed: 100% traditional (stocks/bonds/gold), 95% traditional + 5% Bitcoin, 90% traditional + 10% Bitcoin. Demonstrates Bitcoin's outsized impact even at small allocations.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 5, Section 4: "Bitcoin vs Traditional Store of Value Assets"
- After S2F comparison and before DCA strategies

**Purpose:**
- Show empirical long-term performance data
- Compare Bitcoin to traditional hedges (gold, real estate)
- Demonstrate superior store of value despite volatility
- Provide factual basis for Bitcoin allocation thesis

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Over the past decade (2013-2023), Bitcoin has vastly outperformed traditional stores of value including gold, real estate, and equities. While more volatile, its long-term trajectory reflects growing recognition as digital scarcity and inflation hedge."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ All five assets clearly distinguishable
✅ Bitcoin shows highest growth (despite volatility)
✅ Logarithmic scale used correctly
✅ Returns appear roughly accurate for period
✅ Colors match specifications
✅ Professional investment analysis quality
✅ Fair comparison (same baseline, same period)

**Reject if:**
❌ Lines overlap confusingly
❌ Returns appear inaccurate
❌ Linear scale (would compress lower performers)
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Too artistic (should be data-focused)
❌ Missing labels or legend
❌ Looks biased (should be factual)

## Data Accuracy Note

Approximate returns to verify (2013-2023, ~10 years):
- **Bitcoin:** +10,000% to +15,000% (highly volatile)
- **S&P 500:** +150% to +200%
- **Gold:** +30% to +50%
- **Real Estate (Case-Shiller):** +80% to +100%
- **Cash (USD):** -20% to -30% (inflation erosion)

These are approximate ranges; actual values vary by exact dates and data sources.
