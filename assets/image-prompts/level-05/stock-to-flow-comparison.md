## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean horizontal bar chart comparing stock-to-flow ratios across different assets, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). Show five horizontal bars arranged vertically, each representing a different asset with its S2F ratio. From top to bottom: (1) Bitcoin (post-2024 halving): S2F ratio ~120+ - represented by a very long bar in bright gold (#FFD000), (2) Gold: S2F ratio ~62 - represented by a medium-long bar in muted gold (#D4AF37), (3) Silver: S2F ratio ~22 - represented by a shorter bar in light gray (#C0C0C0), (4) Platinum: S2F ratio ~9 - represented by an even shorter bar in medium gray (#808080), (5) Fiat Currency (USD/EUR): S2F ratio approaching 1 - represented by a tiny bar in muted red (#FF4444). Each bar should be labeled on the left with the asset name and on the right with the specific S2F ratio value in white text. Use a logarithmic scale to accommodate the wide range of values. Include a title at the top: "Stock-to-Flow Ratio Comparison" and a subtitle explaining the metric: "Higher S2F = Harder Money (Existing Stock ÷ Annual Production)". To the right of the chart, add a small key insight box highlighting Bitcoin's unique position: "Bitcoin becomes the hardest money ever created after each halving." The style should be clean financial/economic data visualization, similar to commodity analysis reports - precise, factual, authoritative. No artistic flourishes, no photographs - pure data clarity. The composition should immediately convey Bitcoin's superior scarcity compared to all other store-of-value assets.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Timeline Projection):
Show Bitcoin's S2F ratio increasing over time through halvings: 2016 (S2F ~25), 2020 (S2F ~50), 2024 (S2F ~120), 2028 (projected). Emphasizes progressive scarcity. Area chart with Bitcoin overtaking gold and continuing upward.

### Variation B (Physical vs Digital):
Two-panel comparison. Left: "Physical Commodities (S2F limited by production costs)" showing gold, silver, platinum. Right: "Bitcoin (S2F enforced by code)" showing exponentially increasing scarcity. Emphasizes Bitcoin's unique programmatic hardness.

### Variation C (Monetary Hardness Scale):
Vertical scale from "Soft Money" at bottom (fiat) to "Hard Money" at top (Bitcoin post-2024). Assets positioned along this scale based on S2F. Visual representation of monetary hardness hierarchy.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 5, Section 2: "Digital Scarcity and Stock-to-Flow"
- After explaining S2F concept and before discussing inflation protection

**Purpose:**
- Compare Bitcoin scarcity to traditional stores of value
- Show quantitative superiority over gold
- Introduce S2F as objective hardness metric
- Demonstrate halving's impact on scarcity

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Stock-to-flow ratio measures monetary hardness by comparing existing supply (stock) to annual production (flow). Bitcoin's S2F exceeds gold's after each halving, making it the hardest money ever created. Fiat currencies have S2F near 1, as central banks can rapidly expand supply."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Bitcoin bar is clearly longest (showing superiority)
✅ S2F values are accurate (Bitcoin ~120, Gold ~62, etc.)
✅ Colors match specifications (gold, gray, red)
✅ Logarithmic scale used appropriately
✅ Professional data visualization quality
✅ S2F concept explained clearly
✅ Comparison is fair and factual

**Reject if:**
❌ S2F values inaccurate
❌ Bitcoin doesn't appear superior
❌ Linear scale makes comparison confusing
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Too artistic (should be data-focused)
❌ Missing asset labels or values
❌ Looks biased rather than factual

---

## Data Accuracy Note

Ensure S2F values match current estimates:
- **Bitcoin (post-2024 halving):** ~120-130
- **Gold:** ~58-62 (varies by production year)
- **Silver:** ~20-25
- **Platinum:** ~8-10
- **Fiat (USD/EUR):** ~1-2

Source: Stock-to-flow calculations based on existing supply divided by annual production rates.
