## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Design a circular cycle diagram showing the perpetual debt trap mechanism, rendered as a clean infographic on a pure black background (#000000). Create a circular flow with 5-6 stages arranged clockwise around a central axis. Each stage should be represented by a simple geometric icon connected by curved arrows (muted red #FF4444) indicating the cyclical nature. The stages should be: (1) "Take Loan" - represented by a document/contract icon in white, (2) "Consume/Spend" - represented by a shopping cart or purchase icon in gold (#FFD000), (3) "Income Insufficient" - represented by a declining bar chart in red, (4) "Interest Accumulates" - represented by stacked coins growing in height, (5) "Need New Loan" - represented by another contract icon, larger than the first, (6) "Debt Grows" - represented by an upward arrow or expanding circle. The arrows connecting these stages should have subtle motion blur or gradient effects to suggest continuous flow. In the center of the cycle, place a symbolic icon representing the trapped borrower - perhaps a simplified circular icon with inward-pointing arrows, or a downward spiral symbol, rendered in dark red. Above the entire diagram, add a minimal title in clean sans-serif: "The Debt Cycle" in white. Each stage should have a brief 1-2 word label beneath it. The overall composition should feel like a perpetual motion machine or hamster wheel - emphasizing the inescapable nature of the cycle. Style should be flat vector design with subtle shadows for depth, technical and educational rather than emotional or manipulative. The diagram should look like something from an economics textbook or financial literacy course - factual, clear, and sobering.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Spiral Emphasis):
Downward spiral visualization where each loop represents a new debt cycle, with the spiral getting tighter and darker as it descends. Gold at the top (first loan) transitioning to deep red at the bottom (trapped). Black background, geometric precision.

### Variation B (Hamster Wheel Metaphor):
Circular wheel with a symbolic figure running inside, never making progress. Each step on the wheel represents a debt obligation. Red wheel on black background, minimalist and symbolic (not literal).

### Variation C (Clock Face):
Debt cycle represented as a clock, but instead of hours, each position shows a debt stage. Arrows move clockwise in perpetual motion. Emphasizes the time-based trap. Clean, geometric, technical style.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 2, Section 5: "The Endless Debt Cycle"
- After explaining how consumer debt compounds

**Purpose:**
- Visualize the psychological and financial trap of debt
- Show systemic nature (not individual failure)
- Demonstrate how debt begets more debt
- Make abstract cycle concept concrete

**Accompanying Text:**
> "The debt cycle is self-reinforcing: insufficient income leads to borrowing, interest accumulation requires new loans, and each cycle increases total debt burden. Breaking free requires escaping the system entirely."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Circular/cyclical nature is immediately obvious
✅ Flow direction is clear (clockwise)
✅ Stages are distinct and labeled
✅ Conveys "trapped" feeling without being manipulative
✅ Colors match specifications
✅ Professional educational quality
✅ Looks factual, not sensationalist

**Reject if:**
❌ Layout is confusing (not clearly cyclical)
❌ Too many stages (should be 5-6 maximum)
❌ Looks fear-mongering or manipulative
❌ Photorealistic or includes actual people
❌ Too artistic/abstract (should be clear diagram)
❌ Wrong color scheme
