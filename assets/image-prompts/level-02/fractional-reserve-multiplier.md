## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean, minimalist infographic showing the fractional reserve banking multiplier effect as a cascading flow diagram. Start with a single $100 deposit at the top left, represented as a gold coin or dollar bill icon in libertarian gold (#FFD000). From this initial deposit, show the 10% reserve requirement: $10 stays in the bank (shown in white/gray as a locked vault icon), while $90 flows to the right as a loan (shown as flowing arrow in muted red #FF4444). This $90 loan then gets deposited in another bank (second tier), where again 10% ($9) is reserved and $81 flows out as a new loan. Show this cascading pattern through 4-5 tiers, with each tier getting progressively smaller. At the bottom right, show the final total: "$100 initial deposit → $900 created from thin air" with the created money highlighted in red to emphasize the artificial expansion. Use a pure black background (#000000) for maximum contrast. The flow should be clearly directional (left to right, top to bottom) with clean arrows connecting each stage. Include minimal text labels: "Initial Deposit $100", "Reserve $10", "Loan $90", "Total Money Created: $900". Style should be flat design infographic with geometric precision, educational and technical rather than artistic. Numbers should be in monospace font (IBM Plex Mono style). The composition should feel like a financial textbook diagram or banking system flowchart - authoritative, factual, and clear. No human figures, no photorealism.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Vertical Cascade):
Vertical waterfall diagram showing deposit flowing downward through multiple bank tiers. Each tier shows reserve (10%) staying put and 90% flowing to next tier. Gold at top transitioning to red at bottom. Black background, geometric shapes representing banks.

### Variation B (Tree Structure):
Tree/network diagram where initial $100 deposit branches into multiple loans. Each branch shows 10:1 multiplication. Visual metaphor of exponential growth from single seed. Gold trunk, red branches, black background.

### Variation C (Calculator Display):
Symbolic representation of a calculator or digital display showing the mathematical formula: "$100 × 10 = $1000". Then show breakdown of how reserve requirements create this multiplier. Minimalist, technical aesthetic.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 2, Section 3: "How Banks Create Money from Deposits"
- After explaining fractional reserve requirements

**Purpose:**
- Visualize abstract concept of money multiplication
- Show how $100 becomes $900 in new loans
- Demonstrate systemic leverage in banking
- Make the "money from nothing" concept concrete

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Through fractional reserve banking, a single $100 deposit cascades through the banking system, creating $900 in new loans. With just 10% held in reserve, banks transform deposits into exponentially larger credit supplies."
