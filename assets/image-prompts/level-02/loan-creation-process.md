## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean, step-by-step process diagram showing how commercial banks create money through lending, displayed horizontally from left to right on a pure black background (#000000). Show three distinct sequential stages connected by directional arrows. Stage 1 (left): "Borrower Applies" - represented by a simple document/application icon in white with a person silhouette approaching a bank building icon (simplified geometric shape in white/gray). Stage 2 (center): "Bank Creates Account Entry" - show a symbolic database or ledger interface with two simultaneous entries appearing: one showing "+$50,000 Loan Asset" (in gold #FFD000) and another showing "+$50,000 Deposit Liability" (in muted red #FF4444). Emphasize that these are digital entries only - no actual money changes hands. Use a keyboard or computer screen icon to reinforce the digital nature, perhaps with binary code (0s and 1s) flowing around it. Stage 3 (right): "Money Exists" - show the borrower now having $50,000 in their account (gold dollar symbol or number), ready to spend, while the bank simultaneously has a $50,000 asset on their books. Below the main process flow, include a key insight in a highlighted box: "No depositor money used - created from nothing via accounting entries." Use minimal, clean typography (Inter font style, 14-16px equivalent) for labels. The style should be flat vector design with subtle isometric elements for the bank building and computer interface, maintaining a technical, educational aesthetic. This should look like a financial training diagram or central bank educational material - authoritative, factual, precise. No photographs, no human faces, no artistic interpretation - pure informational clarity. The composition should clearly show that money is created digitally through accounting, not transferred from existing deposits.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Split Screen):
Left side: empty bank vault (nothing there). Right side: borrower's account shows $50,000. Center: computer keyboard being pressed. Emphasizes that money came from nowhere. Black background, gold numbers, white/gray vault.

### Variation B (Ledger Close-Up):
Extreme close-up of a digital ledger/spreadsheet with two entries being typed simultaneously: "Assets: +$50,000 Loan" and "Liabilities: +$50,000 Deposit". Shows double-entry bookkeeping creating money. Minimalist, focused on the accounting mechanism.

### Variation C (Three-Panel Timeline):
Panel 1 (Before): "$0 in system". Panel 2 (During): "Bank keystroke/database entry". Panel 3 (After): "$50,000 exists". Shows creation from nothing via time progression. Clean, minimal, black background.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 2, Section 4: "How Commercial Banks Create Money When They Lend"
- After explaining that banks don't lend depositor money

**Purpose:**
- Clarify that banks create money, not transfer it
- Show double-entry bookkeeping mechanism
- Emphasize digital nature of money creation
- Dispel common misconception about lending from deposits

**Accompanying Text:**
> "When a bank approves a loan, it doesn't transfer existing deposits. Instead, it simultaneously creates a new asset (the loan) and a new liability (the deposit) through accounting entries. This is how commercial banks expand the money supply."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Three stages clearly distinguishable
✅ Sequential flow is obvious (left to right)
✅ Double-entry accounting visible (asset + liability)
✅ Emphasizes digital creation, not transfer
✅ Colors match specifications
✅ Professional educational quality
✅ Dispels "lending from deposits" myth
✅ Looks like authoritative financial documentation

**Reject if:**
❌ Shows physical money or vault transfers
❌ Implies banks lend from deposits
❌ Too complex or cluttered
❌ Photorealistic or 3D rendered
❌ Includes human faces or dramatic imagery
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Accounting mechanism not clear

## DALL-E 3 Adaptation

If using DALL-E 3, emphasize:
- "Flat diagram, not photorealistic"
- "Technical schematic style"
- "No physical money shown"
- "Focus on digital accounting entries"
- "Educational infographic clarity"

DALL-E tends toward literalism, so explicitly request symbolic/diagrammatic representation of the accounting process.

## Quality Enhancement Note

This image is critical for dispelling the common misconception that banks lend out depositor money. The visual must clearly show that:
1. No existing money is moved
2. New money is created through accounting
3. The process is digital (keystrokes/database entries)
4. Both an asset and liability are created simultaneously

If the generated image doesn't clearly communicate all four points, it should be regenerated.
