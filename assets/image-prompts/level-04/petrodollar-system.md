## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean, technical diagram showing the petrodollar system flow, arranged in a triangular/cyclical relationship between three key actors on a pure black background (#000000). Position three simplified geometric icons representing: (1) United States (represented by a simple flag icon or "US" text in white at top left), (2) Saudi Arabia/OPEC (represented by oil barrel icon in dark blue #4477FF at top right), and (3) Global Economy (represented by globe/world icon in gray at bottom center). Show the flow relationships with thick directional arrows: From US to Saudi: "Military Protection" (white arrow with label). From Saudi to Global: "Oil Sold in USD Only" (blue arrow pointing to multiple global buyers). From Global back to US: "Dollar Demand Created" (gold arrow #FFD000 showing dollars flowing back to US). In the center of this triangle, add a key insight box highlighting: "Oil = Dollar Backing (Post-1971)". Each arrow should have a brief label explaining the flow. The composition should emphasize that this is a three-way arrangement that maintains dollar hegemony through oil trade denomination. Use clean, geometric shapes for all elements - no photographs, no realistic imagery. Style should be geopolitical analysis infographic, similar to what you'd see in Foreign Affairs or IMF reports - authoritative, factual, educational. Below the diagram, add a subtitle: "How USD Maintains Global Reserve Status Without Gold" in small white text. The visual should immediately convey the mutual dependencies that sustain the petrodollar system.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Timeline Integration):
Show petrodollar system establishment chronologically: Panel 1: "1971 - Gold Standard Ends" (broken chain), Panel 2: "1974 - Saudi Agreement" (handshake), Panel 3: "1974-Present - Oil USD Mandate" (oil barrel with dollar symbol). Shows historical context.

### Variation B (Before/After Split):
Two-panel comparison. Left: "Pre-1971: Gold-Backed Dollar" (gold bar). Right: "Post-1974: Oil-Backed Dollar" (oil barrel). Shows the transition of dollar backing mechanism. Emphasizes the swap.

### Variation C (Global Map View):
World map with arrows showing oil flowing from Middle East to consuming nations, and dollars flowing back to US. Visualizes global scale of petrodollar system. Blue for oil routes, gold for dollar routes.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 4, Section 2: "The Petrodollar System and Oil-Backed Currency"
- After explaining Nixon Shock and before discussing dedollarization

**Purpose:**
- Clarify what replaced gold as dollar backing
- Show geopolitical arrangement maintaining USD hegemony
- Visualize mutual dependencies (oil, security, currency)
- Establish context for dedollarization discussion

**Accompanying Text:**
> "After abandoning gold in 1971, the US established a new arrangement: Saudi Arabia and OPEC would sell oil exclusively in dollars in exchange for military protection. This created artificial global dollar demand, maintaining reserve currency status without commodity backing."
