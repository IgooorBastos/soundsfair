## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean, data-focused area chart showing the decline of the US dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves from 1970 to 2023, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). The chart should show a declining trend line starting from approximately 85% in 1970 (upper left) gradually decreasing to approximately 59% by 2023 (lower right). Render the area under the curve with a gradient fill transitioning from muted gold at the top (#FFD000 at 30% opacity) to muted red at the bottom (#FF4444 at 30% opacity), visually representing the "bleeding away" of dollar dominance. The X-axis should show years in intervals (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2023) in white text. The Y-axis should show percentage from 0% to 100% in white text. Mark key historical events along the timeline with small vertical reference lines and brief labels: "1971 - Nixon Shock" (gold marker), "2000 - Euro Introduction" (blue marker), "2022 - Ukraine Sanctions" (red marker). Above the chart, include a clear title: "US Dollar Share of Global Foreign Reserves (1970-2023)" in white. Below the chart, add a key insight: "Peak: 85% (1970s) → Current: 59% (2023)" in contrasting colors showing the decline. The style should be financial/economic data visualization, similar to IMF or World Bank reports - authoritative, factual, clean. Use a subtle grid in very dark gray (#1A1A1A) for reference. No photographs, no artistic interpretation - pure data clarity. The composition should convey a clear, undeniable downward trend without being alarmist.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Multi-Currency Stacked Area):
Stacked area chart showing multiple reserve currencies over time: USD (declining, in red at top), EUR (growing, in blue), CNY (emerging, in orange), Other (in gray). Shows not just USD decline but what's replacing it. More comprehensive view.

### Variation B (Before/After Comparison):
Two pie charts side-by-side. Left: "1970 - USD Reserve Share: 85%" (large gold slice). Right: "2023 - USD Reserve Share: 59%" (smaller red slice, with EUR, CNY, Other taking remaining share). Shows shift at a glance.

### Variation C (Acceleration Emphasis):
Line chart with slope/rate of change visualization. Show that dedollarization is accelerating post-2022. Use derivative indicators or steeper decline angle in recent years. Emphasizes current urgency.
