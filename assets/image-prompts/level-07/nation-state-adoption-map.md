## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a world map showing different levels of nation-state Bitcoin adoption and strategic positioning, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). Show a simplified world map (continents in dark gray #2A2A2A) with countries highlighted in different colors based on their Bitcoin adoption status: (1) Legal Tender / Official Adoption (bright gold #FFD000): El Salvador, Central African Republic (mark with large ₿ symbols), (2) Strategic Reserve Holdings (orange #FFA500): US (various states), Germany, Ukraine (mark with medium ₿ symbols and "Reserve" label), (3) Mining Powerhouses (green #10B981): USA, Kazakhstan, Russia, Canada, Norway (mark with pickaxe or hash symbol), (4) Major Private Adoption / Friendly Regulation (blue #4477FF): Switzerland, Singapore, UAE, Japan, Portugal (mark with small ₿ symbols), (5) Hostile / Banned (red #FF4444): China (post-2021), some African/Asian nations (mark with prohibition symbol). Include a legend explaining each category. Add timeline markers for key events: "2021: El Salvador Legal Tender", "2021: China Mining Ban → Hash Rate Migration", "2022: War Reserves (Ukraine)", "2024: US State-Level Strategic Reserves". Use small icons or flags (simplified) to identify key countries. The style should be geopolitical analysis / think tank report quality - data-driven, objective, comprehensive. No propaganda, just factual mapping of adoption patterns. The visual should show the global, multi-faceted nature of Bitcoin adoption at nation-state level.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Timeline Evolution):
Three world maps showing progression: (1) 2017: Mostly hostile/uncertain (red/gray), (2) 2021: El Salvador breakthrough + mining redistribution (more gold/green), (3) 2024: Strategic reserves emerging (more orange/gold). Shows adoption acceleration.

### Variation B (Adoption Pyramid):
Pyramid showing levels of state adoption. Base: Private citizens using (widest, many countries). Middle: Friendly regulation (fewer countries). Top: Legal tender/reserves (smallest, few countries). Shows current adoption hierarchy.

### Variation C (Strategic Importance):
Heat map showing countries where Bitcoin is most strategically important (darker gold = more important). Criteria: inflation rate + capital controls + banking instability + geopolitical isolation. Shows where Bitcoin matters most.
