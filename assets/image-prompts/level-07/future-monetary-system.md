## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a conceptual diagram showing three possible future monetary system scenarios, displayed as a three-panel horizontal timeline on a pure black background (#000000). Each panel should represent a different potential future (2030-2040 timeframe): Panel 1 (Left, 33% width) - "Scenario A: Continued USD Dominance": Show a traditional pyramid with USD at the top (in fading/declining red #FF4444), other currencies below (EUR, JPY, GBP in muted blue). Label: "Status Quo Extension (Declining Probability)". Visual indicators of stress: cracks in pyramid, instability symbols. Panel 2 (Center, 33% width) - "Scenario B: Multipolar Fiat": Show multiple pillars of equal or near-equal height representing different reserve currencies: USD, EUR, CNY, BRICS Currency (each in different muted colors - red, blue, orange, green). No single dominant currency. Label: "Multiple Fiat Currencies Compete (Medium Probability)". Show trade flows between pillars. Panel 3 (Right, 33% width) - "Scenario C: Bitcoin Standard": Show a solid foundation layer in gold (#FFD000) representing Bitcoin as neutral settlement/reserve layer, with various national currencies (USD, EUR, CNY, etc.) floating above as accounting units but backed by or convertible to BTC. Label: "Neutral Bitcoin Base Layer (Growing Probability)". Show stability and neutrality indicators. Below all three panels, add a timeline arrow pointing right with text: "Increasing Probability over Time →" and subtitle: "The future monetary order is being determined now." The style should be futures analysis / strategic foresight quality - thoughtful, scenario-based, acknowledging uncertainty while showing distinct possibilities. No propaganda, no certainty claims - focused on plausible alternative futures.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Decision Tree):
Show as a branching decision tree from "Current System (2024)" splitting into three future paths. Each branch labeled with key decision points: "Can USD maintain reserve status?", "Do BRICS create alternative?", "Does neutral settlement layer emerge?". More analytical structure.

### Variation B (Probability Distribution):
Three scenarios shown as probability distribution over time (2024-2040). Lines showing: USD dominance probability declining (red line going down), Multipolar probability stable/slight increase (blue line flat), Bitcoin standard probability increasing (gold line going up). Shows shifting probabilities.

### Variation C (Geopolitical Power Map):
Three world maps showing power distribution under each scenario. Scenario A: US-centric (traditional), Scenario B: Multiple power centers (distributed), Scenario C: Truly distributed/neutral (Bitcoin). Geographic visualization of power shifts.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 7, Section 5: "The Future: Multipolar Monetary System"
- Near end of Level 7, after all geopolitical analysis

**Purpose:**
- Present plausible future scenarios (not predictions)
- Show Bitcoin as one possible (growing) outcome
- Acknowledge uncertainty and competing visions
- Encourage strategic thinking about monetary future

**Accompanying Text:**
> "The future monetary system is uncertain. USD dominance may persist, though stresses are visible. A multipolar system with competing fiat currencies may emerge. Or Bitcoin may become the neutral settlement layer beneath national currencies. The outcome depends on decisions being made today by nations, institutions, and individuals."

## Midjourney-Specific Tips

**Recommended Parameters:**
```
--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6 --s 250
```

**Negative Prompts:**
```
--no photographs, realistic imagery, 3d render, propaganda, certainty claims, political bias, complex details
```

**Style Keywords:**
- "scenario planning"
- "futures analysis"
- "strategic foresight"
- "alternative futures visualization"
- "geopolitical scenarios"
- "think tank analysis aesthetic"

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Three scenarios clearly distinguishable
✅ Each scenario plausible and distinct
✅ Uncertainty acknowledged (not predictions)
✅ Colors match specifications
✅ Professional futures analysis quality
✅ Neutral presentation (doesn't force one outcome)
✅ Probability indicators included

**Reject if:**
❌ Scenarios are unclear or overlap
❌ Presents one scenario as certain outcome
❌ Looks propagandistic (Bitcoin maximalist)
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Too complex or cluttered
❌ Missing probability/uncertainty indicators
❌ Too artistic (should be analytical)

## Educational Note

This visualization should maintain intellectual honesty about the uncertain future. While the course has a Bitcoin-positive perspective, this specific image should present genuinely plausible alternative scenarios, not a predetermined outcome. The goal is to show:
1. **Multiple futures are possible** (not deterministic)
2. **Current system has stresses** (not sustainable status quo)
3. **Bitcoin is a growing scenario** (probability increasing, but not guaranteed)

Avoid triumphalism or certainty claims. Strategic foresight requires acknowledging uncertainty.
