## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clear comparison table/diagram contrasting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) with Bitcoin across key properties, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). Design a side-by-side comparison with two columns: Left Column (50% width) - "CBDCs (Digital Fiat)": Header in muted red (#FF4444). List key properties with red X or negative indicators: "Centralized control (government)", "Supply: Unlimited/Inflationary", "Programmable (can expire, restrict usage)", "Privacy: Full surveillance capability", "Censorship: Can freeze/seize funds", "Permissioned: Requires authorization", "Monetary policy: Central bank discretion". Use icons to represent each property (e.g., government building for centralization, infinity symbol for unlimited supply, surveillance camera for tracking, padlock for control). Right Column (50% width) - "Bitcoin (Decentralized Money)": Header in libertarian gold (#FFD000). List contrasting properties with gold checkmarks or positive indicators: "Decentralized (no single authority)", "Supply: Fixed 21 million cap", "Non-programmable (rules unchangeable)", "Privacy: Pseudonymous, optional", "Censorship: Resistant", "Permissionless: Open to anyone", "Monetary policy: Fixed algorithm". Use corresponding icons in gold. In the center, add a bold dividing line with text: "Fundamentally Opposite Systems". At the bottom, include a key insight box: "CBDCs are digital fiat with enhanced control. Bitcoin is digital scarcity with enhanced freedom. Both are 'digital,' but the similarities end there." The style should be technical comparison / consumer rights infographic - clear, factual, emphasizing the critical philosophical differences. No emotional appeals, no propaganda - pure structural comparison of system properties.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Control Spectrum):
Show a horizontal spectrum from "Maximum Control" (left, red) to "Maximum Freedom" (right, gold). Position CBDCs at far left (government control) and Bitcoin at far right (individual sovereignty). Cash somewhere in middle. Shows control vs freedom axis.

### Variation B (Surveillance Pyramid):
Show pyramid of monetary surveillance. Top (worst): CBDCs with total surveillance capability. Middle: Traditional banking with limited privacy. Bottom (best): Bitcoin with pseudonymity. Emphasizes privacy gradient.

### Variation C (Three-Column with Cash):
Add cash as middle column between CBDCs and Bitcoin. Shows: CBDCs (digital, traceable, centralized), Cash (physical, private, centralized), Bitcoin (digital, pseudonymous, decentralized). Complete comparison including legacy system.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 7, Section 3: "Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) vs Bitcoin"
- After BRICS discussion and before nation-state adoption

**Purpose:**
- Clarify that "digital currency" ≠ cryptocurrency
- Show CBDCs are enhanced fiat, not alternatives to fiat
- Demonstrate Bitcoin's fundamental differences
- Counter narrative that CBDCs compete with Bitcoin

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Central Bank Digital Currencies are digital versions of fiat money with enhanced control capabilities—programmable money that can expire, restrict purchases, or be frozen at will. Bitcoin is fundamentally different: decentralized, censorship-resistant, and with fixed supply. Both are 'digital,' but they represent opposite visions of money's future."

## Midjourney-Specific Tips

**Recommended Parameters:**
```
--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6 --s 200
```

**Negative Prompts:**
```
--no photographs, realistic imagery, 3d render, artistic interpretation, propaganda, emotional imagery, people
```

**Style Keywords:**
- "comparison table"
- "technical property chart"
- "consumer rights infographic"
- "system architecture comparison"
- "digital money contrast"
- "clean educational design"

---

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Properties clearly contrast between systems
✅ "Opposite systems" concept obvious
✅ All key differences listed (control, supply, privacy, etc.)
✅ Colors match specifications (red vs gold)
✅ Professional educational quality
✅ Neutral, factual tone
✅ Icons/indicators clear and consistent

**Reject if:**
❌ Differences unclear or ambiguous
❌ Missing critical properties
❌ Looks propagandistic or alarmist
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Too complex or cluttered
❌ Implies CBDCs are similar to Bitcoin
❌ Too artistic (should be technical comparison)

---

## Educational Emphasis

This comparison is critical for preventing confusion. Many people hear "digital currency" and assume CBDCs are like Bitcoin. The visualization must clearly show:
1. **CBDCs = Enhanced Fiat** (more control, more surveillance)
2. **Bitcoin = Alternative to Fiat** (less control, more freedom)
3. **"Digital" ≠ "Decentralized"** - technology ≠ architecture
