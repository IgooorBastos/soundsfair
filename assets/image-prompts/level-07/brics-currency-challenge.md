## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a geopolitical flow diagram showing the emergence of BRICS as an alternative to the US dollar system, displayed on a pure black background (#000000). The composition should show two competing financial systems: Top/Left section (40% of canvas): "USD-Based System (Declining)" - Show a network centered around the US dollar (represented by $ symbol or "USD" text in muted red #FF4444) with traditional allies connected: EU, Japan, UK, South Korea, Australia (shown as simplified flag colors or country labels in blue #4477FF). Show this network with fading/declining indicators (transparency effect or dotted lines suggesting weakening ties). Bottom/Right section (60% of canvas): "BRICS+ Alternative System (Emerging)" - Show an emerging network centered around BRICS nations: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, plus recent additions (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran) represented as geometric icons or country labels in gold (#FFD000) and orange (#FFA500). Show this network with strengthening indicators (solid lines, growing connections). Between the two systems, show:  flows indicating dedollarization (arrows pointing away from USD system toward BRICS), (2) trade relationships bypassing USD (direct bilateral trade lines in gold), (3) alternative payment systems (CIPS, SPFS mentioned as text labels). In the center, position Bitcoin (₿ symbol in bright gold) as a neutral alternative that both systems might use. Include a timeline marker: "2009: Bitcoin | 2023: BRICS Expansion | 2024+: Multipolar Currency System?". The style should be geopolitical analysis / foreign policy report quality - authoritative, neutral, factual. No propaganda, no bias toward either system - objective visualization of shifting power dynamics.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Reserve Currency Share Pie Charts):
Two pie charts side by side. Left: "2000 - Global Reserve Currency Share" (USD 70%, others 30%). Right: "2030 Projected" (USD 40%, EUR 20%, CNY 15%, BRICS Currency 10%, BTC 5%, Others 10%). Shows projected shift over time.

### Variation B (Trade Settlement Evolution):
Timeline showing three eras: (1) 1974-2020: "Oil traded in USD" (dollar dominance), (2) 2020-2025: "BRICS bilateral trade in local currencies", (3) 2025+: "Neutral settlement (Bitcoin/gold)". Shows evolution of trade settlement.

### Variation C (Two Pillars):
Two architectural pillars representing monetary systems. Left: "USD System" (cracking, red). Right: "Multipolar System" (under construction, gold). Shows transition and structural weakness/strength.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 7, Section 2: "BRICS and Alternative Reserve Currency Systems"
- After discussing dedollarization and before Bitcoin's role

**Purpose:**
- Show concrete alternatives emerging to USD system
- Visualize multipolar currency system trend
- Demonstrate geopolitical drivers of Bitcoin adoption
- Set context for Bitcoin as neutral reserve asset

**Accompanying Text:**
> "BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and their expanding alliance seek alternatives to dollar dominance. Through bilateral trade agreements, alternative payment systems, and potential commodity-backed currencies, they're building a parallel financial architecture. Bitcoin emerges as a neutral settlement layer both systems might adopt."
