## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a three-panel comparison infographic showing network topology evolution from centralized to decentralized, displayed horizontally on a pure black background (#000000). Each panel should be of equal width (approximately 33% of the canvas). Panel 1 (Left) - "Centralized Network": Show a single large node (server/authority) at the top center in muted red (#FF4444), with 8-10 smaller nodes arranged in a radial pattern below it, all connected exclusively to the central node with thin red lines. This represents traditional banking/server architecture. Label: "Single Point of Failure" beneath. Panel 2 (Center) - "Federated Network": Show 3-4 medium-sized nodes (in orange/yellow) with multiple smaller nodes clustered around each, representing a semi-distributed system like traditional payment networks. Some cross-connections between clusters. Label: "Multiple Points of Control". Panel 3 (Right) - "Decentralized Network (Bitcoin)": Show a mesh network of 20-30 nodes of relatively equal size in libertarian gold (#FFD000), with extensive interconnections forming a web pattern - each node connected to multiple other nodes, no central hub, no hierarchy. Label: "No Single Point of Failure". Use consistent node styling across all three panels: simple circles with subtle glow effects. Connection lines should be thin, with Panel 3 having the most dense connectivity. Below all three panels, add a visual indicator showing the progression: "Fragile → Vulnerable → Resilient" with arrow pointing right. The composition should clearly demonstrate that decentralization increases network resilience through redundancy. Style should be technical network topology diagram, similar to what you'd see in networking textbooks or protocol documentation. Clean, geometric, educational. No photographs, no human figures, no artistic interpretation.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Attack Resistance):
Same three topologies, but show what happens when nodes are attacked/removed (represented by red X or broken nodes). Centralized: entire network fails. Federated: partial failure. Decentralized: network survives. Emphasizes security benefit.

### Variation B (Single Large Visual):
One large network diagram that transitions from centralized (left) to decentralized (right) through gradual mesh densification. Visual gradient from red (centralized) to gold (decentralized). Shows evolution rather than comparison.

### Variation C (3D Sphere Projection):
Show decentralized network as a 3D sphere of interconnected nodes (isometric view), contrasted with a 2D star pattern (centralized). Emphasizes dimensionality and robustness of decentralization.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 3, Section 4: "Decentralization and Network Security"
- After explaining why decentralization matters for censorship resistance

**Purpose:**
- Visualize abstract concept of decentralization
- Show contrast with centralized systems
- Demonstrate network resilience through topology
- Clarify Bitcoin's architectural advantage

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Unlike centralized banking systems with single points of failure, Bitcoin's decentralized network topology means no single entity controls the system. With thousands of nodes validating transactions, the network remains operational even if many nodes go offline."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Three topologies clearly distinguishable
✅ Progression from centralized to decentralized obvious
✅ Equal visual treatment for fair comparison
