## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a powerful, minimalist visualization of Bitcoin's fixed supply cap, centered on a pure black background (#000000). Design a large, prominent "21,000,000" numeral displayed in bright libertarian gold (#FFD000), positioned in the center-upper portion of the canvas. Use a bold, geometric sans-serif font (Inter Black or similar) at very large size, making it the dominant visual element. Below this number, show a clean horizontal progress bar or supply gauge spanning 60-70% of the canvas width. The bar should be divided into two sections: (1) the filled portion (approximately 93%) in solid gold (#FFD000) representing the ~19.6 million BTC already mined, and (2) the remaining unfilled portion (approximately 7%) in dark gray (#2A2A2A) representing the unmined supply yet to be released through 2140. Above the supply bar, add a minimal label: "Total Supply: Hard Cap" in white. Below the bar, include two data points in smaller text: left side "~19.6M BTC Mined (93%)" in gold, right side "~1.4M BTC Remaining (7%)" in gray. At the very bottom, add a key differentiator in a subtle highlight box: "Encoded in Protocol - Cannot Be Changed" in white text with gold border. The composition should feel like a precise data visualization or dashboard metric, authoritative and factual. Consider adding a very subtle Bitcoin symbol (₿) watermark in dark gray (#1A1A1A) as a large background element behind the number, barely visible but adding depth. No gradients, no artistic flourishes, no photographs - pure data clarity with maximum impact. The visual should immediately communicate absolute scarcity and immutability.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Comparison Bar):
Two horizontal bars stacked vertically. Top: "Bitcoin Supply: 21M Fixed" (gold bar with hard edge). Bottom: "Fiat Money Supply: Infinite" (red bar extending beyond canvas edge with "..." indicating continuation). Emphasizes Bitcoin's unique scarcity.

### Variation B (Vault/Lock Metaphor):
The number "21,000,000" inside a symbolic digital vault or lock icon, representing immutability. The vault is closed/locked with a prominent padlock symbol in gold. Shows security and unchangeability. Black background, gold lock, white number.

### Variation C (Timeline to 2140):
Horizontal timeline from 2009 to 2140 showing Bitcoin issuance gradually approaching 21M asymptotically. Area chart format with gold fill approaching but never exceeding the 21M ceiling line. Emphasizes long-term distribution schedule.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 3, Section 5: "The 21 Million Hard Cap"
- After explaining halving schedule and issuance reduction

**Purpose:**
- Make absolute scarcity tangible and memorable
- Show current progress toward cap
- Emphasize immutability (cannot be changed)
- Contrast with infinite fiat supply (implicitly)

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Bitcoin's supply is permanently capped at 21 million coins, encoded in the protocol and enforced by every node. With approximately 19.6 million already mined, less than 7% remains to be issued over the next century. No central authority can inflate this supply."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ "21,000,000" is the dominant visual element
✅ Supply cap feels absolute and immutable
✅ Progress bar clearly shows 93% mined
✅ Colors match specifications (gold/gray/white/black)
✅ Immutability emphasized in messaging
✅ Clean, minimalist, data-focused
✅ Professional dashboard/metric quality
✅ High contrast and legibility

**Reject if:**
❌ Number is not prominent enough
❌ Looks artistic rather than data-focused
❌ Progress bar is confusing or inaccurate
❌ Includes physical coin imagery
❌ Too cluttered or busy
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Doesn't convey "unchangeable" feeling

## DALL-E 3 Adaptation

If using DALL-E 3, emphasize:
- "Dashboard metric style, not artistic"
- "Large bold numerals as focus"
- "Clean data visualization"
- "Minimalist infographic"
- "No photorealism or 3D effects"

DALL-E tends toward visual complexity, so explicitly request minimal, data-focused composition.
