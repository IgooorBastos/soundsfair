## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a technical process diagram showing the proof-of-work mining cycle, arranged as a circular flow on a pure black background (#000000). The diagram should show 4 key stages in a clockwise cycle: (1) "Collect Transactions" - represented by multiple small transaction icons (simplified document/receipt symbols) in white being gathered into a mempool (shown as a container or collection area), (2) "Build Block Candidate" - show these transactions being arranged into a block structure (geometric cube in dark gray #2A2A2A), (3) "Hash Computation (Mining)" - this is the critical stage, show it prominently with a computational element: a hash function symbol or chip/processor icon actively working, with thousands of attempted hash outputs flowing out (represented as streams of alphanumeric strings in muted red #FF4444, most being rejected), (4) "Valid Hash Found" - show a single hash that meets the difficulty target breaking through, highlighted in bright gold (#FFD000) with a checkmark or target symbol indicating success. This successful hash then connects to "Block Added to Chain" and the cycle begins again. In the center of the cycle, show the key constraint: "Target: Hash must start with X leading zeros" with a visual example like "0000000000A3F7..." in gold. Below the difficulty target, show a symbolic representation of computational work - perhaps a power/energy icon or a counter showing millions of attempts. The style should be technical infographic with subtle motion blur on the hash computation stage to emphasize the trial-and-error process. Use clean directional arrows (gold) connecting stages. The overall composition should convey that mining is a computationally intensive lottery, not a guaranteed process. No photographs, no mining hardware photos, no human figures - pure process visualization.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Lottery Machine Metaphor):
Show mining as a cryptographic lottery machine. Inputs: block candidate. Process: billions of random hash attempts (shown as spinning numbers). Output: one winning hash in gold. Black background, technical but uses lottery metaphor for accessibility.

### Variation B (Maze/Puzzle Solving):
Represent proof-of-work as solving a cryptographic puzzle. Show a complex maze or puzzle structure with billions of failed attempts (red) and one successful path (gold) leading to the solution. Symbolic representation of computational search.

### Variation C (Target Practice):
Show hash attempts as projectiles being fired at a very small target (representing the difficulty constraint). Millions of misses (red), one hit (gold). Emphasizes probabilistic nature and difficulty.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 3, Section 3: "Proof-of-Work and Bitcoin Mining"
- After explaining hash functions and difficulty adjustment

**Purpose:**
- Visualize the trial-and-error nature of mining
- Show computational work required (not magic)
- Demonstrate why mining secures the network
- Clarify that it's probabilistic, not deterministic

**Accompanying Text:**
> "Bitcoin mining is a computational lottery. Miners repeatedly hash block candidates with different nonces, searching for a hash that meets the difficulty target. On average, the network tries billions of hashes every 10 minutes before finding a valid solution."

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Cycle nature is clear (continuous process)
✅ Trial-and-error emphasized (many failures, one success)
✅ Difficulty target/constraint visible
✅ Computational intensity conveyed
✅ Colors match specifications
✅ Technical and accurate
✅ No physical hardware shown (abstract process)
✅ Professional educational quality

**Reject if:**
❌ Shows physical mining hardware or computers
❌ Makes mining look easy or deterministic
❌ Difficulty target not explained
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Too artistic/abstract (should be process-focused)
❌ Includes cryptocurrency symbols unrelated to the process
❌ Photorealistic or 3D rendered
