## Primary AI Generation Prompt

Create a clean, technical visualization of a blockchain as a chain of connected blocks, displayed horizontally from left to right on a pure black background (#000000). Show 5-6 individual block representations as geometric cube/rectangular shapes in dark gray (#2A2A2A) with thin gold outlines (#FFD000). Each block should contain simplified visual elements representing: (1) a small hash identifier at the top (represented by a short alphanumeric string like "A3F7...B2C4" in monospace font), (2) transaction data in the middle (shown as 2-3 horizontal lines in white, representing transaction records), and (3) a reference to the previous block's hash at the bottom (shown as another short hash string with a backward-pointing arrow). Connect each block to the next with a thick gold arrow (#FFD000) pointing right, emphasizing the directional chain nature. The first block (leftmost, genesis block) should be highlighted slightly brighter or with a subtle gold glow to distinguish it. The entire chain should have a subtle 3D isometric perspective (not flat, but not fully 3D rendered) to give depth while maintaining the infographic aesthetic. Below the chain, add a minimal label: "Distributed Ledger - Immutable Chain of Blocks" in white text. The composition should feel technical and precise, like a computer science textbook diagram or blockchain protocol documentation. No photographs, no artistic interpretation, no human figures - pure structural clarity. The visual should immediately convey the linked, sequential nature of blockchain architecture.

## Alternative Prompt Variations

### Variation A (Top-Down View):
Aerial/top-down view of blockchain as a series of connected nodes arranged in a linear chain. Each node shows hash connections. Emphasizes network topology. Black background, gold connections, white/gray nodes.

### Variation B (Data Flow Emphasis):
Show blockchain with animated-style data flowing through it (represented by motion blur or particle effects). Emphasizes that blockchain is active, constantly processing. Gold data streams, dark gray blocks, black background.

### Variation C (Merkle Tree Integration):
Show a single block in detail with a Merkle tree structure visible inside (hierarchical hash tree). Demonstrates internal structure. More technical, suitable for advanced explanation. Isometric cube with tree diagram inside.

## Usage Context

**Where to Place:**
- Level 3, Section 2: "What is a Blockchain?"
- After initial blockchain definition, before cryptographic details

**Purpose:**
- Visualize abstract concept of "chain of blocks"
- Show hash linking mechanism
- Demonstrate sequential, immutable nature
- Provide mental model for blockchain structure

**Accompanying Text:**
> "A blockchain is a chain of blocks, each containing transaction data and cryptographically linked to the previous block through hash references. This structure makes historical data immutable—changing any past block would break the entire chain."

## Midjourney-Specific Tips

**Recommended Parameters:**
```
--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6 --s 250
```

**Negative Prompts:**
```
--no photographs, people, 3d realistic render, artistic interpretation, colorful, cluttered, cartoonish, cryptocurrency symbols, coins
```

**Style Keywords:**
- "technical blockchain diagram"
- "computer science infographic"
- "protocol documentation style"
- "subtle isometric blocks"
- "linked data structure"
- "hash chain visualization"

## Quality Criteria

**Approved if:**
✅ Chain structure is immediately obvious
✅ Individual blocks clearly distinguishable
✅ Hash linking mechanism visible
✅ Sequential direction clear (left to right)
✅ Colors match specifications (black/gray/gold)
✅ Technical and precise (not artistic)
✅ Genesis block identified
✅ Professional educational quality

**Reject if:**
❌ Blocks look like physical objects (should be data structures)
❌ Too artistic or abstract (should be technical)
❌ Hash references not visible
❌ 3D photorealistic render (should be isometric infographic)
❌ Includes cryptocurrency symbols or coins
❌ Wrong color scheme
❌ Cluttered or confusing layout
