**Score: 89/100** (highest across all criteria)

The Lantern logo perfectly embodies soundsfair's mission to illuminate the path to Bitcoin knowledge. It's unique, memorable, emotionally warm, and tells your brand story better than any alternative.

While the Sound Wave is more versatile and easier to implement, and the Shield conveys more authority, neither captures the educational warmth and unique positioning that the Lantern provides.

For a platform dedicated to bringing **fair money education** to the world with warmth, clarity, and hope — the answer is **THE LANTERN**.
